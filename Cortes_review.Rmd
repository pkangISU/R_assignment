There are some things you should look over and review in your code.
  
  The way you inspected the files runs very slowly, at least on my computer. Viewing the files repeatedly froze RStudio to the point that I couldn't completely run the project.
  
  The transpose function doesn't work well for files that have headers.
  
  There was a fatal error on line 169 that said "Error: Column 1577 must be named."
  
  Hard-coding each chromosome filter, arrangement, and character replacement is not ideal. A for-loop would have been better instead.
  
  There should be two individual files for each chromosome, one in ascending order of position the other in descending order. 
  
  You saved all your graphs to the same filename, overwriting all but the last one.
